# Modelling-Anxiety
An exploration into using predictive modelling to understand and forecast symptoms, based on a Diary-based reporting system. This project is not affiliated with any medical organization, and is not intended as part of treatment. If you have concerns about Anxiety or Mental illness, consult your physician.

# Project Summary
Many of those who experience anxiety and anxiety-adjacent conditions struggle to identify the conditions under which they are most likely to have an unusually acute attack of their symptoms. However, many common interventions, from CBT (Cognative Behavioral Therapy) to medication, work best when applied during the early stages of symptoms, or, if possible, in advance. This project will explore using predictive modelling to extract insights and, if possible, forecasts from a data set generated from a "Diary-based" approach to documenting symptoms. The data set was generated over a period of several months, and documents the severity and times of an acute attack, along with a full schedule of daily activities taken part in on that day.

Data capture occured in an Excel CSV. Exploration will take place in a combination of SPSS and R.
